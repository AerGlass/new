space on you'r hard disc </p>

<h1> Making You'r firt hello world! </h1> </p>
This page is made on html.
NOTE: I can't write something like some command so I will just use pictures. </p>
create a folder in your desktop name as you like. open the folder then create a </p>
text file, name it "index.html" remplace the extension txt for html, if windows doesn't like that, press accept </p>
Select the text file and do left click and then select: Edit with notepad++ </p>
I made a text file containing the simple Hello World! <a href="ex.txt">here </a>, recommend to download the html and study </p>
from there,don't really know why, thats how I learned. This tutorial will teach you more. is just a hello world to see if it works.</p>
Right click and select "save as" and select the html file that you just created. the next section will teach you how to put your own text.</p>
